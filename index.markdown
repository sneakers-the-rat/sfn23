# Abstract

> If our wildest dreams for scholarly infrastructure are to outsource our archives to Amazon and pay Elsevier for prestigious PDFs, it might be time to wake up. One can only admire the boldness of neuroscientists grappling with the staggering complexity of the brain 20 pages and 20 mice at a time. More than our ambition, skill, or resources, it is our infrastructures that constrain our work. If we consider our digital infrastructural problems separately, we find ourselves tracing familiar patterns: a mutually incompatible string of journal-like venues, cloud storage, and SaaS platforms. 
>
>We present a different strategy, a new generation of peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols for social information infrastructures to bridge data, computation, and communication. Learning from decades of prior art from p2p, decentralized messaging, Semantic Web, federated social media, and wiki communities, we propose a protocol for content-addressed containers of linked data triples in an explicitly social system, blending the best of traditional p2p and federated systems. 
>
> In this first phase of development, we will present results from a proof of concept protocol designed to integrate data from prevailing neurophysiology formats and the wild vernacularism of hand-structured data. Rather than a backwards-incompatible system-of-everything that requires radically reconfiguring existing practice, we show how p2p can bridge resources from rig computers, lab and institutional servers, and existing cloud archives to make each more useful than in isolation. 
>
> We plot a course for future work where by taking the social reality of infrastructure seriously we can reimagine publishing data and results as a continual process of collaboration, communication, and cooperative governance, rather than some exogenous burden at the end of an experiment where we throw ourselves at the mercy of multiple adversarial industries. Beyond the practical limitations of archives with always-higher storage and egress bills and a communication system riddled with perverse incentives, sleepwalking into a near-future where we hand ownership of scientific infrastructure to a few for-profit information conglomerates would be an ethical nightmare.
>
> We can either become yet another engine of the enclosure of digital infrastructure, or we can use our rare position as publicly funded researchers not beholden to profit to seed information systems for the public good. This work is an invitation to my colleagues to join us in future phases of development, integrating existing projects with new ones, and reclaiming our joy and agency rebuilding the systems that define the daily practice of science
